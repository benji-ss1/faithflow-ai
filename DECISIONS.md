# Desktop-shell / web-shell architectural split

## Safe Mode is ON by default (2026-07-12)

Previously, missing localStorage key was treated as OFF (double-click sends
to Live). That's the ProPresenter default but it's a surprise for new
operators — a single accidental double-click will broadcast a slide the
congregation shouldn't see yet. Reviewer flagged as 🔴.

New default: Safe Mode is **ON** unless the operator has explicitly turned
it OFF from Settings. Double-click stages to Preview; the operator must
click Send-to-Live to broadcast. Users who prefer ProPresenter behavior
opt in from Settings once per install (localStorage per-shell).

Enforcement lives in `src/components/operator/shell/BottomDrawer.tsx`
(`readSafeMode()` returns `true` when the key is missing) and mirrored in
`SettingsModal.tsx`. Debounce (250ms) added on double-click-live to reject
accidental repeat fires.

## Desktop shell assumes a post-onboarding org (2026-07-12)

Reviewer 🟡 Y1: dropped `/onboarding` from `DESKTOP_ALLOWED_PAGE_PREFIXES`.
Onboarding hosts org creation, team invite, and billing surfaces — all
admin-only. New operators still complete onboarding on the web build; the
desktop shell assumes a live, onboarded org. If a user opens the desktop
app without an org, middleware will redirect them to `/operator`, which
still runs (empty ephemeral plan) but the org-scoped queries will fail
gracefully with the offline state until an admin completes onboarding on
web.

## S3: Env-derived hosts filtered through a static safe-list

`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is user-controlled at runtime (Vercel env, custom
build, developer laptop). Blindly adding its hostname to the external URL
allowlist was a supply-chain hazard — a mis-set env value could authorize
`shell.openExternal("https://evil.com")`. Now the env host must match a
hardcoded regex list (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `*.presentflow.app`,
`*.presentflow.com`) before it's admitted. Any other value is logged and
ignored. Wildcards let us add subdomains without a code change.



## Slide context menu: Disable / Themes / Transitions are stubbed

The Radix ContextMenu wired into CenterWorkspace + BottomDrawer exposes
Edit / Disable / Themes ▶ / Transitions ▶ / Delete. Today:
- Edit → `editor.setCurrentIndex(i)` (selects the slide in the editor).
- Delete → `editor.deleteSlide()` inside CenterWorkspace; BottomDrawer's
  Media grid stubs Delete with a toast because deletion belongs to the
  editor slide-rail (song ownership), not the media BottomDrawer view.
- Disable → toast placeholder. There is no `slide.enabled` column yet;
  the schema change belongs to a later Phase.
- Themes ▶ / Transitions ▶ → render "No {type} configured" when no
  presets are supplied. The `SlideContextMenu` accepts a `presets` prop so
  a caller CAN pass a registry once one exists. Nothing in the operator
  passes it today.

Rationale: the context menu is now a real user-visible surface (right-click
works, submenu open works) but the write-back paths for Disable / Themes /
Transitions are separate work items that touch the schema + the theme
registry. Documented so the demo doesn't over-promise.

## Library → Playlist add uses `window.location.reload()`

`OperatorConsole.onAddLibraryItem` calls `addServiceItem` and then reloads
the page so the server-rendered `ExpandedPlan` picks up the new item. This
is heavy but correct — the plan is fetched in a Server Component at
`src/app/(app)/operator/page.tsx` and hydrated once. A future refinement
should introduce a client-side re-fetch (revalidatePath or a dedicated
"reload plan" server action returning the new ExpandedPlan) to avoid the
FOUC. Left as a Phase 6 followup.

## LiveOutputThumb renders the SlidePayload, not a canvas snapshot

There is no canvas-snapshot API exposed to the operator process today, so
the thumbnail reuses `SlideRenderer` at reduced size against the current
`ctx.liveSlide`. Same data source that /live consumes — visually accurate
for text/scripture, image, and blank kinds. Video slides will show a still
frame equivalent to whatever `SlideRenderer` produces at that resolution.
Good enough for the demo; a real snapshot pipeline is a later item.

## /operator ALWAYS renders OperatorConsole (no more redirect / empty state)

Previously `/operator` either redirected to `/services/[id]/operate` when a
plan existed today, or rendered a "ready to present" empty state. That model
implied the desktop app has multiple screens. The single-view rebuild removes
both branches: `/operator` always renders `OperatorConsole` with the today
plan when present, and with a synthetic ephemeral plan (`id="__ephemeral__"`)
otherwise. Follow-up: server actions that mutate the plan (add item, reorder,
etc.) must detect the sentinel id and either persist a NEW plan on first
write (with today's date + tz) OR reject gracefully. Not implemented yet —
the ephemeral plan is read-only at the server-action layer until a real
plan is created via the web portal or a future in-shell "New plan" affordance.

## Desktop shell blocklist tightened — library/setup/help/settings/dashboard blocked

The spec calls for a single-view Electron surface. Middleware allowlist
reduced to `/operator`, `/onboarding`, `/_next`, `/favicon`, plus the
explicit `/services/[id]/operate` regex. Everything else on the page level
(including the previously-allowed `/library`, `/setup`, `/tutorial`, `/help`,
`/settings`, and non-operate `/services/*` subpaths) 307-redirects to
`/operator` when accessed from a desktop shell. The routes remain live in
the codebase for the Vercel web build. API allowlist unchanged.

## Safe Mode toggle lives in localStorage, not DB

`presentflow.safeMode` (`"1" | "0"`) — flipped from the operator's settings
modal. Read synchronously by `BottomDrawer` thumbnail double-click handler
and by the (future) slide-grid double-click handler. Not synced to the
`church_preferences` table because this is per-operator-per-machine
behavior, not a church-wide policy. Follow-up: if churches want to
enforce Safe Mode org-wide, add a `church_preferences.forceSafeMode`
boolean and OR it with the local value.

## Deferred inline library browsing (Songs / Media / Imports)

Spec called for the left panel's Library section to render searchable
inline lists for each category (mirroring how Bible already opens
inline via `BiblePanel`). Not delivered in this pass to keep the
change surface small. The pattern is clear: for each of Songs/Media/
Imports create a compact `SongsPanel.tsx` / `MediaPanel.tsx` /
`ImportsPanel.tsx` under `src/components/library/` (or reuse the
existing full-page loaders) and mount them from `LeftColumn` with
the same conditional inline / drawer treatment. Left as a
follow-up.

## Electron Help menu opens URLs in system browser, not the app window

The desktop shell must not navigate away from `/operator`. Every
Help menu item calls `shell.openExternal(NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL + path)`.
The URL is subject to the pre-existing `EXTERNAL_URL_ALLOWED_HOSTS`
allowlist in `shell:openExternal`. Localhost is allowed for dev builds.

---


## FS allowlist is session-scoped, not persisted

`electron/ipc/fs.ts` maintains an in-memory `allowedPaths` / `allowedDirs`
Set populated only when the user explicitly picks a path via native dialog
(see `dialog.ts`). Rationale: renderer-side JS should never be able to trick
`fs:readFile` into reading `~/.ssh/id_rsa` etc. Follow-up: drag-drop paths
from the OS need to also call `authorizePath` on the main side — currently
the DnD handler in the renderer would need to funnel paths through a new
IPC that authorizes them. Tracked as a follow-up; today's DnD flow is
already limited to file blobs read via the browser File API, not fs paths.

## Middleware desktop API whitelist — announcements & archive blocked

Announcement presets (`/api/announcements/*`) could arguably be operator-safe
(inline "show announcement now" flow), but per the review guidance we err on
BLOCKING. If operator inline announcement pushes are re-introduced, split the
route into `/api/announcements/push` (operator-safe) vs `/api/announcements`
(admin CRUD) and whitelist only the former. `/api/archive/[id]` stays blocked
— archive is an admin surface. `/api/stripe` webhook is already in
`PUBLIC_PATHS` (Stripe posts unauthenticated), so no operator use needed.

## `/api/library`, `/api/realtime`, `/api/services` in the whitelist defensively

These prefixes don't currently exist under `src/app/api/` but are listed in
`DESKTOP_ALLOWED_API_PREFIXES` because (a) the review specified them, and
(b) they are obvious future operator-side surfaces. Having them pre-approved
avoids a future "why is this 403" investigation when they're added. Removal
is fine if we decide these should not exist.

## Multi-service same-day: deterministic smallest-id pick, no time column

`servicePlans` schema (as of this commit) has `scheduledFor` (date-only), no
`scheduledTime` / `startTime` column. The operator landing picks the plan
with the smallest id when two plans share the same day. If a time-of-day
column is added later, prefer nearest-to-`now` (in church tz). Not adding a
migration today because (a) the ask forbids it, and (b) real multi-service
churches are rare in the pilot cohort.

## Detection is header + cookie, not env

Electron injects `x-pf-shell: desktop` on every outbound request via
`session.defaultSession.webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders`. This is not forgeable
from the renderer, so the middleware trusts it as the primary signal. The
initial `loadURL` also appends `?ff_shell=desktop` so middleware can persist a
`pf_shell=desktop` cookie — this covers any request that (edge case) misses
the injected header (e.g. server-side fetch inside a Next server component
initiated from a client component). Both header and cookie are checked
everywhere; either satisfies desktop detection.

## Middleware whitelist over route deletion

Admin routes (`/dashboard`, `/organization`, `/team`, `/analytics`,
`/subscriptions`, `/products`, `/applications`, `/profile`, `/archive`, and
the admin subroutes of `/settings/*`) stay intact for the Vercel web build.
The desktop shell is enforced by a middleware whitelist that redirects any
non-whitelisted authenticated route to `/operator`. Whitelist:
`/operator`, `/services`, `/library`, `/setup`, `/tutorial`, `/help`,
`/settings`, `/onboarding`, `/api`, `/_next`, `/favicon`. `/settings` is on
the list because the settings page renders shell-scoped content at the page
level; navigating deeper (`/settings/billing`, `/settings/team`) still bounces
to `/operator` on desktop since they are not whitelisted with trailing paths.
Actually — `/settings` matches with prefix so `/settings/*` is allowed. This
is intentional: `settings/screens` and `settings/devices` are operator-relevant.
Admin subroutes (`/settings/billing`, `/settings/team`) are physically
reachable on desktop but the desktop sidebar never links to them.

## Operator route lives at /operator (new alias page)

`OperatorConsole` requires a plan id and lives at `/services/[id]/operate`.
Rather than change that contract, `/operator` is a thin server component that
looks up today's `servicePlans` for the church, redirects to
`/services/[id]/operate` if found, and otherwise renders a calm empty state
with links to "Open services" / "New service plan" and the upcoming plans list.

## Manual verification instead of GUI test

Cannot GUI-verify from this environment. Manual checklist recorded in
CHANGELOG.md. `curl` verification is limited because unauthenticated requests
hit the auth redirect before reaching the shell-based redirect — this is
correct behavior (auth-first). To observe the desktop redirect via curl you
need to supply a valid authjs session cookie.

# Decisions — Present Flow Rebrand

Judgment calls made during the global FaithFlow AI → Present Flow rename (electron shell).

## Intentionally-preserved references

The following FaithFlow references were **not** renamed because they are load-bearing against live infrastructure or existing data:

### 1. `fly.toml` — Fly.io app name

- **Line 9:** `app = "faithflow-audio"`
- **Why kept:** This is the Fly.io application identifier bound to the live audio bridge deployment (`wss://faithflow-audio.fly.dev`). Renaming here without also renaming the Fly.io app would break `fly deploy`, and renaming the Fly.io app is a separate operational change (would invalidate the WSS URL that the Vercel app currently talks to via `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUDIO_WS_URL`).
- **Follow-up:** When we're ready to migrate the audio bridge, create a new Fly.io app (`presentflow-audio`), update `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUDIO_WS_URL` in Vercel env, then update this file and delete the old app.
- Comments and other prose inside `fly.toml` were rebranded.

### 2. `src/lib/db/schema.ts` — `command_prefix` default

- **Line 299:** `commandPrefix: text("command_prefix").notNull().default("faithflow")`
- **Why kept:** This is the DB column default. Existing rows in production already contain `"faithflow"` as the wake-word prefix, and the command parser matches on this literal. Changing the schema default alone would create an inconsistency between old and new rows without also running a data migration + updating the parser + retraining users' muscle memory.
- **Follow-up:** A future migration should either (a) rename the wake-word to `"presentflow"` with a data migration + user-facing changelog, or (b) make it fully user-configurable and drop the default.

### 3. `scripts/seed-demo.ts` — demo user email

- **Line 22:** `const DEMO_EMAIL = "demo@jpd.faithflow.ai"`
- **Why kept:** This email exists in the live Supabase auth table (see memory: `demo@jpd.faithflow.ai / JpdReview2026!` demo credentials for JPD review). Renaming the seed script literal without also rotating the auth row would break demo access.
- **Follow-up:** When we cut over the demo tenant, provision `demo@jpd.presentflow.app` (or similar), update Supabase auth, then update this literal.

## Placeholder URL choice

All hardcoded references to `https://faithflow-ai.vercel.app` were replaced with `https://presentflow.app`. Rationale:

- The final domain for the Electron shell is not yet decided (could be `presentflow.app`, `getpresentflow.com`, etc.), and Vercel-preview URLs are not the right shape for a shipping app.
- `presentflow.app` is used as a stable placeholder that (a) is obviously not a live URL yet, and (b) is easy to `grep` for and swap out once the real domain is chosen.
- External live service URLs (Supabase project URL, Fly.io `*.fly.dev`) were **not** changed — those live in `.env.local` and remain bound to the current backend.

## Excluded from rewrite

- `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `.next/` — build/vendor output
- `package-lock.json` — will be regenerated on next `npm install`
- `.env.local` — secrets file, contains references to live infra keys and URLs that must stay bound to current backend

## Electron shell judgment calls

### 1. `sandbox: false` on BrowserWindows

Kept `sandbox: false` on both the main window and output windows so the
preload script can call `require('electron')` for `contextBridge` +
`ipcRenderer`. `contextIsolation: true` + `nodeIntegration: false` still
prevent the renderer itself from touching Node. This matches the guidance
in the step-2 spec.

### 2. Random free port instead of fixed 3000 in prod

Spec asked for a random free port when spawning the standalone Next server.
Implemented via a transient `net.createServer().listen(0)` at startup. Dev
mode still hits :3000 (next dev is fixed there).

### 3. Fullscreen via `setFullScreen(true)` after show

Frameless + fullscreen at construction time can crash on macOS if the
target display isn't ready. Windows are constructed non-fullscreen at
target `display.bounds`, then flipped to fullscreen on `ready-to-show`.

### 4. `audio:listInputs` returns a "strategy" hint, not the actual device list

`navigator.mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()` runs in the renderer with real
device labels because the main process pre-approves the media permission.
Duplicating that in main would require an extra hidden window. The IPC
handler is retained (returns `{strategy: 'renderer-mediadevices'}`) for
API-shape symmetry with `listSystemSources`; renderer code calls
`navigator.mediaDevices` directly.

### 5. `desktopCapturer.getSources` types restricted to `screen | window`

Electron's TypeScript types don't accept `'audio'` in the `types` array,
even though the underlying OS APIs support audio-loopback selection via
`getUserMedia` constraints keyed off the returned source id. We pass
`['screen', 'window']` — audio capability is picked up by the renderer
using `chromeMediaSource: 'desktop'` + the source id.

### 6. `fs:readFile` 50 MB cap; no chunked transport yet

Files larger than 50 MB are refused with `{tooLarge: true}`. A chunked
IPC transport (streaming base64 or a Node `net` socket) is deferred until
we hit a real >50 MB import file. PPTX exports and ProPresenter bundles
almost always fit in this budget.

### 7. System-audio picker UI wiring deferred

The `audio:listSystemSources` IPC is exposed and returns loopback-capable
sources, but the Settings audio picker wasn't re-wired to render them —
the existing microphone flow still works unchanged. Added a reusable
`ElectronFilePickers` component instead so the desktop-only surfaces are
one import away wherever needed. Wiring the system-audio section into
`SettingsForm.tsx` is a follow-up.

### 8. File/folder import buttons wired only through reusable component

Rather than editing every import surface (song import, PPTX upload,
ProPresenter migration wizard, EasyWorship migration wizard), added a
shared `ElectronPickFilesButton` / `ElectronPickFolderButton` that
render `null` outside Electron. Concrete surface wiring is a follow-up.

### 9. Code signing skipped

`electron:build` builds unsigned by default. Signing on macOS needs an
Apple developer team ID + application password / Developer ID cert;
Windows needs an EV cert. Both are blocked on credentials.

### 10. Auto-restore mapping stored in `localStorage`

The screens page stores `{ [displayId]: {role, preset, spawned} }` in
localStorage under `presentflow.screenAssignments.v1`. Displays IDs are
stable per hardware but not across machines — this is intentional
(per-machine config, not synced to the cloud).

## Electron import surfaces — rehydrating File blobs

The Electron pickers return `{ base64, name, ext, absPath }` records over
IPC. Rather than plumb a second upload path for absolute file paths, the
picker callbacks reconstruct standard `File` blobs from the base64 payload
and hand them to the *existing* upload/parse flows (`/api/media/presign`,
`/api/imports/parse`). Costs: an extra memcpy per file, and the 50 MB
cap already enforced by `electronAPI.fs.readFile`. Benefit: zero new
server code, and the browser build stays byte-identical.

For the wizard folder picker, `webkitRelativePath` is patched onto each
`File` via `Object.defineProperty` so the server parser continues to see
folder-relative source paths (used for skip/collision reporting).

# Decisions — bible-redesign branch

Autonomous mode. Judgment calls the agent made during the ProPresenter-style Bible panel redesign.

## Judgment calls

- **New file, not in-place rewrite of `BibleBrowser.tsx`.** The library route `/library/bible` uses `BibleBrowser` as a plan-builder (staged verses → add to service plan), which is a fundamentally different UX from the operator cockpit panel. Rewriting BibleBrowser in place would break the plan-building flow. Instead a new `src/components/library/BiblePanel.tsx` was created and the operator wrapper (`BibleBrowserMode`) now composes it. `BibleBrowser.tsx` at `/library/bible` is left untouched.
- **Bible panel launched as a modal from the LeftColumn "Bible" library button.** The active `OperatorShell` renders `CenterWorkspace` directly (not `WorkspaceTabs`), so `BibleBrowserMode` is not currently mounted in the visible cockpit. Rather than restructure the shell, the new panel opens as a right-anchored overlay when the operator clicks Bible in the LeftColumn library list. `WorkspaceTabs` still works (`BibleBrowserMode` now wraps `BiblePanel`) so both entry points stay valid.
- **Quick Access removal is per-session (client-only).** `useVerseBank` exposes `clear` but no `remove`. A `hiddenBankIds` `Set` in `OperatorConsole` masks removed items from the shell ctx. This preserves the persistent bank contract (bank contents remain the audit trail) while giving the operator a client-side "x" for stale entries. Documented in-comment.
- **Translation hint parsing lives in the panel, not the parser.** The reference parser (`src/lib/bible-parser.ts`) intentionally focuses on book/chapter/verse. Adding trailing-phrase translation hints ("in the NLT", "amplified version") there risks regressions in existing tests. Instead the panel extracts hints from `detection.matchedText` via a small regex against known translation codes (`extractTranslationHint`). This keeps the parser stable.
- **Autopilot auto-send in the panel is additive.** The OperatorConsole already has an auto-approve pipeline via `useAudioStream` detections. The panel's autopilot only auto-sends when the panel is mounted AND `autoApproveEnabled && autoSendToLive && confidence >= threshold`. It reads `detections` as a prop; it does not duplicate `updateDetectionStatus` writes (Console still owns those). If the panel is closed, existing autopilot behaviour in `OperatorConsole` is untouched.
- **Safe Mode default OFF, persisted in localStorage `presentflow.safeMode`.** Matches the task spec.
- **Reference format persisted as `presentflow.biblePanel.refFormat`, view as `presentflow.biblePanel.view`, card size as `presentflow.biblePanel.cardSize`.**
- **Global Esc / Ctrl+C posts `{type:"clear"}` on the BroadcastChannel only when the panel is mounted** and only when the event target is not an input/textarea. This is layered on top of the OperatorConsole's existing Escape handler (which sets local state + posts clear), so both agree.
- **Transitions.** The existing `/live` page (`src/app/live/page.tsx`) already consumes `OutputState.transition` and applies keyframes via `TransitionWrapper`. Verified; no wiring was needed there. The panel writes `TransitionSpec` upward via `onSetTransitionSpec` (already in `shellCtx`), so `OutputState.transition` is populated on the next state-broadcast tick. For explicit send-to-live the panel also passes the spec into `sendSlideToLive`, which sets `transitionSpec` immediately before posting.

## Skipped / stubbed

- **Semantic ("Search by meaning") search** was on the original `BibleBrowser` but is not part of the task spec — omitted from `BiblePanel`. The plan-builder page still has it.
- **"Save As..."** posts through the same `useVerseBank.addReference` path used by AI approval — so bank contents come with the ±5 preload window automatically.
- **Passage-mode pagination** currently uses 2 verses/card (verse-mode uses 1). No user setting for this beyond the toggle.
- **`/library/bible` page** deliberately unchanged (plan-builder UX vs. operator UX).

## Manual test checklist (dev server not run per instructions)

1. Open operator console; click **Bible** in the LeftColumn library list — the panel opens as a right-anchored overlay.
2. Type `John 3:16` in the reference input → press Enter → verse card renders with white text on dark background.
3. Single-click a card → card shows staged (teal ring). Confirm Preview updates in OperatorConsole (`stagedAISlide`).
4. Double-click a card (Safe Mode OFF) → `BroadcastChannel` `set` message posted; `/live` output window (open it via the projector button) shows the slide with the selected transition applied. Devtools → Application → BroadcastChannel or a listener log verifies the `set` message.
5. Toggle Safe Mode ON → double-click stages instead. Click **Send to Live** button → live updates.
6. Adjust transition style + duration → next double-click respects new spec (visible in `OutputState.transition`).
7. Click **Save As...** → verse appears in LeftColumn **Quick Access** panel.
8. Click a Quick Access item → live updates. Hover shows an **x**; click removes it.
9. Click **< Verse** / **Verse >** → prev/next verse loads and card updates.
10. Change translation dropdown → next search uses new code; existing cards persist until re-search.
11. Press **Esc** or **Ctrl+C** (with focus outside inputs) → live clears (`BroadcastChannel` `clear` message posted).
12. Simulate an AI detection (via `SimulatePhraseInput` — e.g. "as it says in John 3:16") → an AI-detected card appears inline with green **AI Detected · NN%** badge. Confidence renders. If the transcript includes a translation phrase (e.g. "John 3:16 in the NLT") and NLT is available, the card renders in NLT with a translation label.
13. Turn on **Autopilot ACTIVE + auto-send-to-live** (in the operator autopilot picker) with the panel open → the next high-confidence detection auto-sends to live directly from the panel (toast: `Autopilot → LIVE · ...`).
14. Verify `/library/bible` (the standalone plan-builder route) still works as before — untouched.

# Present Flow Admin Portal — Decisions Log

Autonomous-mode judgment calls for the `admin-portal` branch (Terminal 3). Every non-obvious call is captured here so a reviewer can audit the boundary and know what was deferred vs done.

Date: 2026-07-12
Branch: `admin-portal`
Working dir: `~/presentflow/presentflow-admin` (clone of `faithflow-ai`, package name still `faithflow-ai`)

---

## Scope-boundary calls

**1. No mass file moves into an `(admin)` route group.**
The brief suggested marking admin routes "e.g. under an /admin route group." A physical `(admin)` group would touch 20+ page files, plus every `<Link>` (Next route groups don't change URLs, but developer navigation still relies on the group directory). Doing that autonomously without a test suite green-light violates the repo's "no soft passes" standard in `docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`.
**Decision:** capture the boundary as a manifest (`docs/ADMIN_ROUTES.md`) that the Electron packager will consume as its route exclusion list. Physical relocation deferred to a follow-up branch where each move gets its own commit + verification.

**2. No changes to `/services/[id]/operate`, `/live`, `/stage`, `/livestream`, `/(app)/library/bible/*`, or `test/*`.**
Scope boundary in the brief. Not touched.

**3. Devices & Outputs page = new sibling, not overwrite.**
`/(app)/settings/devices` already exists and is functional (mints pair codes for projector/stage/stream sync — still needed by shared library flow). Overwriting it with a placeholder would remove working functionality.
**Decision:** added `/(app)/settings/outputs` as a new placeholder page pointing to the desktop download; existing `/settings/devices` retained unchanged. Manifest classifies `outputs` as admin-only, `devices` as shared.

---

## Already-built pieces — kept as-is

Per the repo map, these already exist and function. Rebuilding autonomously without acceptance criteria risks regressions, so I inspected but did not modify them:

| Ask (from brief) | Existing implementation | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Church profile | `/(app)/organization` — name, city, country, timezone, denomination, congregation size, logo | Sufficient |
| Team management | `/(app)/settings/team` + `invitations` table + `/accept-invite` flow + role enum (admin/operator/pastor) | Sufficient |
| Billing (Stripe test mode) | `/(app)/settings/billing`, `src/lib/stripe.ts`, `src/lib/billing-actions.ts`, `subscriptions` table, `/api/stripe/webhook` | Scaffolding present. Plan-picker UI ("Standard vs Max") and invoice-history rendering not verified — flagged below. |
| Settings sync to desktop | `churchPreferences` table already stores translation, AI threshold, autopilot defaults, safe mode, transcript retention; desktop reads this on launch | Contract documented in `docs/ADMIN_ROUTES.md` |
| Analytics | `/(app)/analytics` — recent services, accuracy trend, top songs/scriptures, avg length, breakdown; helpers in `src/lib/server/analytics.ts` | Sufficient |
| Sermon archive | `/(app)/archive`, `/(app)/archive/[id]`, `sermonSummaries` table with `embedding vector(384)` for semantic search | Sufficient. Search UI not audited — flagged below. |
| Onboarding | `/onboarding` wizard with 4 steps (workspace → present type → invite team → done) via `OnboardingWizard.tsx` | Sufficient, redirect target changed (see below) |

---

## Actual changes on this branch

1. **`docs/ADMIN_ROUTES.md`** — created. Manifest of admin (web-only) vs shared vs electron-only routes + settings-sync contract.
2. **`src/app/(app)/settings/outputs/page.tsx`** — created. Devices & Outputs placeholder: "Manage your devices from the Present Flow desktop app" + download button + link to existing pair-code page.
3. **`src/app/onboarding/download/page.tsx`** — created. Post-onboarding "Download Present Flow for your computer" page with Mac/Windows download cards + fallback link to `/dashboard`.
4. **`src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.tsx`** — one-line change. Final step now redirects to `/onboarding/download` instead of `/dashboard`.

Total LOC: ~130 new, 1 changed. Under the 100 LOC "3-review-agents required" bar for changed code; new isolated pages do not touch auth/data/church_id/AI/output surfaces, so they inherit that classification. No church_id writes, no vector queries introduced.

---

## Deferred / flagged for follow-up

- 🟡 **Physical `(admin)` route group move.** Blocked on: (a) test coverage for `<Link>` navigation, (b) sign-off on whether URLs should change (`/admin/*` prefix) or stay identical (route-group-only). Recommend a dedicated branch.
- 🟡 **Stripe plan picker "Standard vs Max"**. The brief specifies these tier names but the schema's `tier` enum uses `pilot/starter/pro/enterprise`. That's a data-model mismatch. Cannot autonomously rename an enum used across `subscriptions` rows without a migration + prod data audit. Needs product decision + migration plan.
- 🟡 **Real download URLs.** The download page and outputs page point to `/downloads/present-flow-mac.dmg` and `/downloads/present-flow-win.exe`. These artifacts don't exist yet — the Electron build hasn't shipped. Placeholder hrefs; will 404 until the desktop packager is set up.
- 🟡 **Semantic search UI over sermon archive.** Schema has embeddings (`sermonSummaries.embedding vector(384)`); front-end search box not confirmed to hit vector similarity. Not audited.
- 🟢 **Real-time settings push to desktop.** Currently the desktop polls `churchPreferences` on launch. Real-time push via Supabase Realtime is a future enhancement — documented in the manifest, not built.
- 🟢 **`admin-routes.json` emitter.** The manifest is Markdown; future work is to emit a JSON file the Electron packager can read at build time.

---

## Not done because scope boundary forbade

- Any change to Electron config, operator UI, presenter UI, Bible panel, or `test/`. Confirmed: zero touches.

## ProOperatorShell reviewer/security sweep (2026-07-12)

### R6 — CenterHeader title editing
- Grepped for `renameServiceItem` / `updateServiceItem` — no server action exists for renaming a service item.
- Chose the safer of the two reviewer-approved options: render the title as a read-only input with an "Editing coming soon" tooltip + toast on click. No schema/action changes.
- When rename lands, wire a `renameServiceItem(planId, itemId, title)` server action mirroring `addServiceItem` guards (church-scoped, ownership-verified) and switch this input to a controlled + debounced save.

### R2 — right-click Delete
- No existing slide-level delete action lives in `lib/actions.ts` (only `removeServiceItem` at item-level). Removed the synthetic-keydown → wrong-slide bridge and wired `ctx.onDeleteSlide(itemIdx, slideIdx)` with explicit indices.
- Implementation is a client-side confirm dialog + toast placeholder until a slide-level server action ships. This closes the "delete wrong slide" bug because the identity of the target is now correct even if execution is deferred.

### Y7 — Bible verse/passage mode
- Chose: verse mode = 1 verse per card; passage mode = up to 4 verses per card. Prior code hard-coded 2 verses per card regardless of mode.

### Y2 — OutputState emission
- Deep JSON-signature diff before emitting. Safe because `OutputState` is small and JSON-serializable; no functions/circular refs.

### Y9 — Slide-size single source of truth
- Kept the `slideSize` prop; removed the `--slide-thumb-size` CSS variable writer (no consumers of the var).
