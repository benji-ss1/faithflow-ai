# Decisions — bible-redesign branch

Autonomous mode. Judgment calls the agent made during the ProPresenter-style Bible panel redesign.

## Judgment calls

- **New file, not in-place rewrite of `BibleBrowser.tsx`.** The library route `/library/bible` uses `BibleBrowser` as a plan-builder (staged verses → add to service plan), which is a fundamentally different UX from the operator cockpit panel. Rewriting BibleBrowser in place would break the plan-building flow. Instead a new `src/components/library/BiblePanel.tsx` was created and the operator wrapper (`BibleBrowserMode`) now composes it. `BibleBrowser.tsx` at `/library/bible` is left untouched.
- **Bible panel launched as a modal from the LeftColumn "Bible" library button.** The active `OperatorShell` renders `CenterWorkspace` directly (not `WorkspaceTabs`), so `BibleBrowserMode` is not currently mounted in the visible cockpit. Rather than restructure the shell, the new panel opens as a right-anchored overlay when the operator clicks Bible in the LeftColumn library list. `WorkspaceTabs` still works (`BibleBrowserMode` now wraps `BiblePanel`) so both entry points stay valid.
- **Quick Access removal is per-session (client-only).** `useVerseBank` exposes `clear` but no `remove`. A `hiddenBankIds` `Set` in `OperatorConsole` masks removed items from the shell ctx. This preserves the persistent bank contract (bank contents remain the audit trail) while giving the operator a client-side "x" for stale entries. Documented in-comment.
- **Translation hint parsing lives in the panel, not the parser.** The reference parser (`src/lib/bible-parser.ts`) intentionally focuses on book/chapter/verse. Adding trailing-phrase translation hints ("in the NLT", "amplified version") there risks regressions in existing tests. Instead the panel extracts hints from `detection.matchedText` via a small regex against known translation codes (`extractTranslationHint`). This keeps the parser stable.
- **Autopilot auto-send in the panel is additive.** The OperatorConsole already has an auto-approve pipeline via `useAudioStream` detections. The panel's autopilot only auto-sends when the panel is mounted AND `autoApproveEnabled && autoSendToLive && confidence >= threshold`. It reads `detections` as a prop; it does not duplicate `updateDetectionStatus` writes (Console still owns those). If the panel is closed, existing autopilot behaviour in `OperatorConsole` is untouched.
- **Safe Mode default OFF, persisted in localStorage `presentflow.safeMode`.** Matches the task spec.
- **Reference format persisted as `presentflow.biblePanel.refFormat`, view as `presentflow.biblePanel.view`, card size as `presentflow.biblePanel.cardSize`.**
- **Global Esc / Ctrl+C posts `{type:"clear"}` on the BroadcastChannel only when the panel is mounted** and only when the event target is not an input/textarea. This is layered on top of the OperatorConsole's existing Escape handler (which sets local state + posts clear), so both agree.
- **Transitions.** The existing `/live` page (`src/app/live/page.tsx`) already consumes `OutputState.transition` and applies keyframes via `TransitionWrapper`. Verified; no wiring was needed there. The panel writes `TransitionSpec` upward via `onSetTransitionSpec` (already in `shellCtx`), so `OutputState.transition` is populated on the next state-broadcast tick. For explicit send-to-live the panel also passes the spec into `sendSlideToLive`, which sets `transitionSpec` immediately before posting.

## Skipped / stubbed

- **Semantic ("Search by meaning") search** was on the original `BibleBrowser` but is not part of the task spec — omitted from `BiblePanel`. The plan-builder page still has it.
- **"Save As..."** posts through the same `useVerseBank.addReference` path used by AI approval — so bank contents come with the ±5 preload window automatically.
- **Passage-mode pagination** currently uses 2 verses/card (verse-mode uses 1). No user setting for this beyond the toggle.
- **`/library/bible` page** deliberately unchanged (plan-builder UX vs. operator UX).

## Manual test checklist (dev server not run per instructions)

1. Open operator console; click **Bible** in the LeftColumn library list — the panel opens as a right-anchored overlay.
2. Type `John 3:16` in the reference input → press Enter → verse card renders with white text on dark background.
3. Single-click a card → card shows staged (teal ring). Confirm Preview updates in OperatorConsole (`stagedAISlide`).
4. Double-click a card (Safe Mode OFF) → `BroadcastChannel` `set` message posted; `/live` output window (open it via the projector button) shows the slide with the selected transition applied. Devtools → Application → BroadcastChannel or a listener log verifies the `set` message.
5. Toggle Safe Mode ON → double-click stages instead. Click **Send to Live** button → live updates.
6. Adjust transition style + duration → next double-click respects new spec (visible in `OutputState.transition`).
7. Click **Save As...** → verse appears in LeftColumn **Quick Access** panel.
8. Click a Quick Access item → live updates. Hover shows an **x**; click removes it.
9. Click **< Verse** / **Verse >** → prev/next verse loads and card updates.
10. Change translation dropdown → next search uses new code; existing cards persist until re-search.
11. Press **Esc** or **Ctrl+C** (with focus outside inputs) → live clears (`BroadcastChannel` `clear` message posted).
12. Simulate an AI detection (via `SimulatePhraseInput` — e.g. "as it says in John 3:16") → an AI-detected card appears inline with green **AI Detected · NN%** badge. Confidence renders. If the transcript includes a translation phrase (e.g. "John 3:16 in the NLT") and NLT is available, the card renders in NLT with a translation label.
13. Turn on **Autopilot ACTIVE + auto-send-to-live** (in the operator autopilot picker) with the panel open → the next high-confidence detection auto-sends to live directly from the panel (toast: `Autopilot → LIVE · ...`).
14. Verify `/library/bible` (the standalone plan-builder route) still works as before — untouched.
